/**
 * The trucks perform the following sequence:
 * Read from their input buffer until they have received 4 deliveries or receive notification that there are no more deliveries.  On each delivery, they must append the truck number for tracking purposes.
 * For each of the four deliveries (or less if the "no more deliveries" notification was received), do the following:
 * Sleep for 0-10 seconds.  This period must be decided randomly.
 * Print out the information on the shipping order to the screen
 * The truck also must also print out a message to the screen after it has received the -no more deliveries- notification and delivered its last order indicating that it is done delivering.  This message should specify the truckâ€™s number and the number of its associated shipping center.
 * The Shipping order information printed to the screen must include the following information:
 *      Delivery address
 *      Name on order
 *      Item ordered
 *      Item category
 *      Shipping Center the order went through
 *      Shipping Center Section the order went through
 *      Delivery Truck the order was delivered on
